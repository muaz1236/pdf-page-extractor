1) write a script in the most suitable language that takes in a pdf document and excise from it the pages that a user provide. For example, a user choose pages 230 - 240 and it fetches those pages from the pdf and save it as another pdf. As the original pdf text is OCR, therefore, the fetched pages must also be OCR.

2) Add a simple frontend GUI interface (efficiency required) where a user is asked to browse for the input pdf, the location and name of the output pdf, and the page numbers.

3) Wrap it in a Windows application such that I only need to run the exe or bash or some other suitable file and it runs the whole program.
